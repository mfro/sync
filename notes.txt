ideas:
  attach
  detach
  update

node:
  /new
  /attach?id=...

namespacing:
  attach is a json path
  would need some sort of access control
  otherwise joining the root would show everything

plans:
  use node approach
  rust probably
  sqlite / mongodb
  consider for the future node ref type to allow referencing other nodes

  WS /new create node
    101 { ... }

  WS /attach?id=...&head=...
    101 { ... }

  WS protocol
    <- { "id": "...", "version": 0, "changes": [...] }
    -> { "version": 0, "changes": [] }

features:
  ref type references a path in the node
  speculation recovery
